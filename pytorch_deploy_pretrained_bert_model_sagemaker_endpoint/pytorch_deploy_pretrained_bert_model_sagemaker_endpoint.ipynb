    "# Deploy a pretrained PyTorch BERT model from Hugging Face Hub on Amazon SageMaker for sentiment analysis in Hebrew\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information. Sentiment analysis is widely applied to voice of the customer materials such as reviews and survey responses, online and social media, and healthcare materials for applications that range from marketing to customer service to clinical medicine.\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT was trained on BookCorpus and English Wikipedia data, which contain 800 million words and 2,500 million words, respectively. Training BERT from scratch would be prohibitively expensive. By taking advantage of transfer learning, one can quickly fine tune BERT for another use case with a relatively small amount of training data to achieve state-of-the-art results for common NLP tasks, such as text classification and question answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service that provides developers and data scientists with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models quickly. Amazon SageMaker removes the heavy lifting from each step of the machine learning process to make it easier to develop high-quality models. The SageMaker Python SDK provides open source APIs and containers that make it easy to train and deploy models in Amazon SageMaker with several different machine learning and deep learning frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our customers often ask for quick fine-tuning and easy deployment of their NLP models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will deploy a pretrained PyTorch BERT model from Hugging Face Hub on Amazon SageMaker for sentiment analysis in Hebrew.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll execute the following steps:\n",
    " - Initiate a [Huggingface pipeline](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/pipelines.html) and save the model and config on the local file system.\n",
    " - Tar GZIP the model and config files and upload `model.tar.gz` to a S3 bucket.\n",
    " - Deploy the model to a SageMaker Endpoint and make few inference requests.\n",
    " - Optional cleanup.\n",
